npm i -D @types/node typescript

most people would do this:
    npm i -D ts-node
    "start": "ts-node src/index.ts"
npx tsconfig.json //made by Ben, for some reasons it didn't work on windows

ts-node is slow and you won't be using it in production
    "watch": "tsc -w",
    "dev": "nodemon dist/index.js",
    "start": "node dist/index.js",
    "dev2": "nodemon --exec ts-node src/index.ts"
so you watch for changes using npm run watch and then you run the changes using npm run dev
as alternative you can run npm run dev2
